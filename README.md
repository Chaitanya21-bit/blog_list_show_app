This is an application made using Flutter that shows a list of blogs after fetching it from an API. You can tap the blogs to see them in full detail, and they also have a feature to add them to favorites. The app uses HIVE for offline (cache) storage. Once the blogs are fully loaded from internet, they are saved into the cache of the  device so that the next time you open the app, it doesn't take as much time as it did previously.
